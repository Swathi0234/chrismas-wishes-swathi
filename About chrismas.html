    <h2>About Chrismas</h2>

    <h3>Chrismas story</h3>
    <p>Christmas is a holiday celebrated on December 25th, commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, a central figure in
        Christianity. Its origins trace back to early Christianity, but the exact date of Jesus' birth is not mentioned
        in the Bible, and the celebration of Christmas was not widely observed until the 4th century.

        Early Christian Era: Early Christians did not celebrate Jesus' birth, focusing more on his death and
        resurrection. However, by the 4th century, the Roman Empire, under Emperor Constantine, adopted Christianity as
        the state religion. The Church established December 25th as the date of Jesus' birth, aligning it with existing
        pagan festivals like the Roman holiday of Saturnalia, which celebrated the winter solstice.</p><br>
